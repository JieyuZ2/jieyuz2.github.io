I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Washington, Seattle, advised by Prof. [Ranjay Krishna](http://www.ranjaykrishna.com/index.html) and Prof. [Alex Ratner](https://ajratner.github.io/). Before that, I was an undergraduate student in Computer Science of University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I was fortunated to be advised by Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). During the past, I spent time at Microsoft Research and ByteDance AI Lab.

**Research Interests**: My current research interests are **interactive and data-centric AI/ML** with an emphasis on faithful evaluation and effort-light approaches with applications in chemistry, biology, physics, etc.. My ultimate goal is to build effective, efficient, and explainable data-centric ML systems. My past explorations lay in the intersection of machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing.
