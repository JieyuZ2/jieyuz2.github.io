I'm a 4-th year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Washington, Seattle, advised by Prof. [Ranjay Krishna](http://www.ranjaykrishna.com/index.html) and Prof. [Alex Ratner](https://ajratner.github.io/). Before that, I was an undergraduate student in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/).

**Research Interests**: My current research interests are **interactive and data-centric AI/ML** with an emphasis on **faithful evaluation** and **effort-light approaches** with applications in natural language processing, computer vision, foundation models, science, etc. I have contributed to many exciting projects including [AutoGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155), [DataComp](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14108), and [BLIP3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08872).

My research is supported by [2024 Apple AI/ML PhD fellowship](https://machinelearning.apple.com/updates/apple-scholars-aiml-2024) (Data-centric AI track) and [OpenAI Superalignment Fellowship](https://openai.com/blog/superalignment-fast-grants).

I'm passionate about mentoring and teaching. I was 
- co-instructor of **CSE 455: Computer Vision (undergrad)**
- TA of **CS 344: Introduction to Data Management (undergrad)**
- TA of **CS 599C: Training Data Management & Weak Supervision (grad)**
- mentor of **CSE 492 R: CSE Group Research (undergrad)**.

I'm happy to mentor a few students on research and especially encourage students from **underrepresented groups** to reach out. If you are a junior student and want to discuss research and/or look for advice, feel free to schedule a chat via this [link](https://calendly.com/jieyuzhang97/30min).
